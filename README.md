# World Builder - Asset Management Tool (Assignment 1 for Game Development in C++)

## How to use and Controls
Import a set of tiles into the Resources/Textures directory.
Launch the application - the tiles should be loaded in and visible in the scrolling window on the right hand side.
Choose the sprites as required and process to build the world!

Left click - > select sprite, draw with the selected sprite.
Right click - > navigate around the world view.
ESC - > export the world to xml.
L -> import the world from an xml.


#### Todo: 
* Add in icons and functionality for sprite manipulation (rotation, flipping etc.)
* Add a layering functionality. This will require a modification of the XML saving logic also.
